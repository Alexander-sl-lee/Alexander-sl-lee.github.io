title: Scraping for jobs with Scrapy
---

Looking for work can be one of the most tiring, long winded processes out there. Wouldn't it be so much easier if someone just gave you a list of all the jobs out there in 
an excel spreadsheet sorted by high/low paying jobs? Well, that's exactly what this project aims to do. I created a script using Scrapy to search through indeed for 1000 jobs that
are related to our key words. 

But beyond that, we can also look at what terms occur more frequently depending on the pay level for these jobs. In this example, I have searched jobs relating to "Data Scientist",
in order to gauge I should expect when entering the market. Try it for you're own job title and see what comes up :).
