title: Predicting AFL Winners 
---

Australian's have been notorious for their addiction to gambling. Unfortunately, judging by the growth of bookies, it doesn't seem as though we're very good at it. This project
uses Logistic Regression among other techniques to predict which team would win in a game of AFL. However, to further reduce the human elements involved, our model incorporates
the use of a fractional Kelly Criterion to advise on how much we should bet.
